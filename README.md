## Comparing Java Spark and Java Spring Boot

### Spring Boot

> Configurability
- Emphasis on convention over configurability. It has tools that constrict the user to writing API code in a structured format.

> Specific Conventions
- These conventions are helpful to maintain consistency in large projects ensuring easy scalability.

### Spark

> Ease of setup

- Allows quick setup for dev and gives flexibility to structure application in a way that I see fit.

> Customization and Freedom

- The freedom to customize the API in any way is a big advantage for small projects.
